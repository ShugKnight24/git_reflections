# How to Use Git and Github Reflections

### 9/27/2017

These are my reflections that were part of the Udacity MOOC, [How to use Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775).

Creating, pushing to, and sharing this repository were all part of the curriculum.

If you struggle with Git and would like to learn the basics, or just want to refresh your skills, I would highly recommend this course. The instructors, Caroline and Sarah do a great job walking you through the material and explaining the commands you will mostly be using if you use Git for version control.

I took this course as a part of going through @P1xt's FAQ guide. If you would like to see my broader thoughts about this course, and see some of the things I learned, check out my posts at [9/24](https://github.com/ShugKnight24/P1xt_guides/blob/master/faq_progress/9_24_17.md), [9/25](https://github.com/ShugKnight24/P1xt_guides/blob/master/faq_progress/9_25_17.md), and [9/26](https://github.com/ShugKnight24/P1xt_guides/blob/master/faq_progress/9_26_17.md).
